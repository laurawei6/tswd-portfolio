I decided to use a line graph for the third visualization because I wanted to visualize trends of government debt as they continued over time. I was interested in seeing % government debt changes for different countries over time, and if the countries with the highest percentage of government debt to GDP ratio change over time. I therefore chose to illustrate this with a line graph that puts color emphasis on the OECD average and the countries that have the highest percentage of government debt to GDP ratio. 

From doing this, I found that the line graph is really clear in showing that the countries with the highest government debt ratios are the highest consistently. Highlighting the OECD average also illustrates this point further. 

# Government Debt Written Summary

The visualizations in order are bar chart, heat map, and line graph. They all come from the same source, data.oecd.org, and talk about the total government debt to GDP ratio countries have. The bar chart shows the ratio per country for a certain year (2020), which makes it easy to be able to compare across countries for one instance in time. The heat map shows the ratio across countries and different years, which helps to separate the countries based on their ratios. This visualization in particular, because it uses colors and numbers, helps people see trends in the data through comparing countries with low ratios to high ratios, but makes it hard to do more specific comparisons between two countries, for example, because the colors tend to be hard to tend apart when the countries are close to each other. This, in addition with the fact that the visualization is very information dense and therefore difficult to quickly glance at for a story, led me to using a line graph for the third visualization.

In this line graph, I wanted to create a simple story: the countries with the highest government debt to GDP ratios consistently have them over time. While I understand that the ratios aren't exactly connected to each other over time, I wanted to easily show to people that countries with higher ratios are consistently high. A line graph made this easy to see over time because visualizations depicting time oftentimes use a line graph. The red color associated with the countries make them stand out against the grays, and matches preconceived notions in the west that financial numbers, when highlighted in red, mean bad. I made the OECD line black to make it stand out against the grays of the other countries', but also to make it easy to have a baseline of comparison for the countries in red.
