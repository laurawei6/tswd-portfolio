# Outline
For my major project, I will be working on a story about the unjust implementation of the death penalty in the United States. My capstone project for my MHCI program is about the same topic, and I'm going to be specifically working with the same dataset that my client, the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) is providing its users for their research. I am both interested in the death penalty space, and think this is a great opportunity to explore the data as some key stakeholders of DPIC might. This topic is sensitive because of people have different political, ethical, moral, and religious viewpoints on it, but I will be focusing on using data to support the claim that the practice of the death penalty as we use it today is unjust.

The audience for this project is anyone who consumes news articles. I think that this topic, while it is touchy, is one that a lot of people can gravitate to because it's related to so many other topics. Whether it's racism or police brutality, or an unfair justice system, there are pieces of this story that most people can relate to or be interested in. Because of the many different angles I can address this topic, I will work on narrowing down my story to one that's concentrated but touches on something that most people can relate to and understand.

I intend to start with showing historical information on how the death penalty perpetuates racism after the abolition of slavery, move onto showing its ties with police brutality and an unfair justice system, and end it with information showing that we can make a difference through using our voices to end the practice of the death penalty.
