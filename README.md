# Portfolio

This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me.

# About me
Hi, my name is Laura, and I'm a masters student studying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at Carnegie Mellon University! I originally studied biology in undergrad at Brandeis University, with the intention of becoming a doctor. However, after working as a medical assistant for a year, I realized I didn't want to go into healthcare. From there, I made a pivot to UX research; I worked as a UX researcher for a consultancy working on products and services for local and state governments. I really enjoyed my work as a UX researcher, and realized that I love learning about people and why they do the things they do!

Fast forward to when I started my program at CMU when I realized that I wanted to be a mixed methods UX researcher who can help make products and services that make a difference through the work that I do. I love data, but I'm not sure how to best visualize it or use it in storytelling. Because of this, I decided to take "Telling Stories with Data," a class that I believe will prepare me well for a career as a UX researcher who is able to make compelling stories and arguments for people. 

In my free time when I'm not doing UX, data, or programming, I enjoy playing video games, playing volleyball, and cooking! Some of my favorite video games at the moment are Plateup, Valorant, and Lethal Company. Some of my favorite recipes to cook are gyuudon, tonkatsu, and san bei ji!

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

- Best practices for creating easy to read, compelling data visualizations.
- Best practices for telling stories using data.
- How to influence others using data storytelling.
- How to create data visualizations that enhance my UX research deliverables.
- Foundation for using Tableau in my career as a mixed-methods UX researcher.

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.

[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
