# About me
Hi, my name is Laura, and I'm a masters student studying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at Carnegie Mellon University! I originally studied biology in undergrad at Brandeis University, with the intention of becoming a doctor. However, after working as a medical assistant for a year, I realized I didn't want to go into healthcare. From there, I made a pivot to UX research; I worked as a UX researcher for a consultancy working on products and services for local and state governments. I really enjoyed my work as a UX researcher, and realized that I love learning about people and why they do the things they do!

Fast forward to when I started my program at CMU when I realized that I wanted to be a mixed methods UX researcher who can help make products and services that make a difference through the work that I do. I love data, but I'm not sure how to best visualize it or use it in storytelling. Because of this, I decided to take "Telling Stories with Data," a class that I believe will prepare me well for a career as a UX researcher who is able to make compelling stories and arguments for people. 

In my free time when I'm not doing UX, data, or programming, I enjoy playing video games, playing volleyball, and cooking! Some of my favorite video games at the moment are Plateup, Valorant, and Lethal Company. Some of my favorite recipes to cook are gyuudon, tonkatsu, and san bei ji!

# What I hope to learn

- Best practices for creating easy to read, compelling data visualizations.
- Best practices for telling stories using data.
- How to influence others using data storytelling.
- How to create data visualizations that enhance my UX research deliverables.
- Foundation for using Tableau in my career as a mixed-methods UX researcher.
