# The final data story
[The death penalty in the US: An arbitrary and unjust practice](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-death-penalty-in-the-us-arbitrary-and-unjust/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II
The original vision I had was showing the history of the death penalty and how its current application was arbitrary, unjust, and simply perpetuating current injustices within the criminal justice system. However, I was having trouble portraying this with the current data that I was able to find. This made my part 2 feel a bit disorganized, and even though my user research sessions helped me with the specific visualizations that I created for the assignment, I think that I missed necessary data to tell an adequate story about the perpetuation of racism done through the death penalty.

I pivoted after finding information about the top reasons why people in the US are supporters of the death penalty. In my research I have done for my capstone, it feels like a lot of what my client is doing is providing facts and data that help dispel misconceptions about the death penalty. The data that surrounds arguments against the death penalty was therefore data that I could readily find and use to help create a story about what people think is justice. This, I felt like, created a strong narrative that interwove data at each point.

## The audience
My audience for my final data story is the general public, but more with an emphasis on people who are probably on the fence about the death penalty or who already are somewhat anti-death penalty. From my research for my capstone project and through who I talked to for part 2, it seemed clear that my story would resonate with people who are already leaning anti-death penalty. People who are staunchly pro death penalty have trouble recognizing other arguments that don't align with their beliefs, so my story wouldn't really convince them anyway. Including more of an emphasis on dispelling misconceptions about the death penalty was also a technique I used in order to target more people who are on the fence.

# Final thoughts
I thought this project itself was really powerful in showing how data and storytelling can be married to create a strong narrative. I would have liked more time to look up more information about historical data and racial inequities, so in the future I might look to find that information myself. Racial disparity in the criminal justice system tends to be a very delicate subject for people to talk about, and because of that, sometimes making a case about racial injustice only works for people who already acknowledge there are racial injustices in the first place. Incorporating a story using this type of data therefore might require more planning and strategy if I still try to reach people who are on the fence about the death penalty.

I was most excited about showing data about the arbitrariness of the death penalty. That's where I wanted to center my entire story at first, which is why part 2 was mostly focused around showing the arbitrariness by state and county. However, I think cutting it down more to focus on a particular state made my story more compelling. The Tableau for showing the number of death sentences per county was also tricky to get working right, so I was VERY excited when it worked well!

All in all, I really enjoyed learning about different visualizations and how I could best utilize them in this project. I think centering my project on common misconceptions about the death penalty made it stronger.
